<h1><u>How to use</u></h1>
<h2>Map settings</h2>
 
<p>This application is a simulation of wildlife evolution.</p>
<p>You can change the map in which you want your creatures to evolve by clicking on the <i>'Change Map'</i> button.
<b>Warning</b> : you cannot change the map once the simulation is launched !</p>
<br>
<p>It is possible to change the map look by setting the biomes ladders. The ladders values indicates the height above which the biome type may appear.
The height value is defined randomly. Set a lower value if you wish for more of one biome type.</p>
<br>
<p>It is also possible to import a map from a PNG file in the 'Import/Export' tab, or directly insert a map seed in the <i>'Options'</i> tab.</p>
 
<p>Once the map settings suits you, you can choose the initial quantity of creatures when the simulation starts.</p>
<p>You can then launch a simulation by clicking the <i>'Launch'</i> button.</p>
 
<h2>During simulation</h2>
<h3>Creatures limits</h3>
<p>During the simulation it is possible to change some settings relative to the number of creatures currently in simulation.</p>
<p>Select a preferred number of creatures on the corresponding ladder to indicate an average number of creatures you want on the board.</p>
<p>If the threshold is crossed, creatures will die faster and faster in order to stay as close as possible to your preferred number</p>
<br>
<p>Select a critical number of creatures on the corresponding ladder to indicate a maximal number of creatures on board. If the threshold is reached, the creatures can reproduce no more.</p>
<h3>Control buttons</h3>
<p>You can use the control buttons in the <i>'Options'</i> tab to increase or decrease the simulation speed.</p>
<h3>Stats tab</h3>
<p>It is possible to click on a creature to have access to its information in the <i>'Stats'</i> tab, as well as general information concerning the current simulation.</p>
<p>It is recommended to pause the simulation (the <i>'Pause'</i> button is located in the <i>'Options'</i> tab) to select a creature easily.</p>
<h3>Import/Export tab</h3>
<p>It is possible to export the current simulation data in a JSON file, by clicking on the corresponding button in the <i>'Import/Export'</i> tab.</p>
<p>If the current map pleases you, it is possible to export by clicking the <i>'Export map to PNG'</i> button. You can then use it in further simulations by importing it (see 'Map settings' section).</p>
