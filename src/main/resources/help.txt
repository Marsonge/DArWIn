How to use
 Map settings
 
This application is a simulation of wildlife evolution.
You can change the map in which you want your creatures to evolve by clicking on the 'Change Map' button. Warning : you cannot change the map once the simulation is launched !
It is possible to change the map look by setting the biomes ladders. The ladders values indicates the height above which the biome type may appear.
The height value is defined randomly. Set a lower value if you wish for more of one biome type.
 
It is also possible to import a map from a PNG file in the 'Import/Export' tab.
 
Once the map settings suits you, you can launch a simulation by clicking the 'Launch' button.
